To initialise the DB you have to run the sql code in this directory in the following order:

1. e-ethelodria.create.sql
2. e-ethelodria.triggers.sql
3. e-ethelodria.inserts.sql

For your convenience a makefile has been introduced to automate the process, but you have to set it up for your local configuration.

Make sure there are no foreign key constraints on Task_List.id and Product_List.id columns in e-ethelodria.create.sql !
